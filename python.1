2️⃣ kubectl get svc
👉 What it shows:

All Services in the namespace.

Services = how Pods are exposed or connected.

Example output:
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
myapp-svc    ClusterIP   10.96.12.45     <none>        80/TCP         10m
db-svc       ClusterIP   10.96.55.23     <none>        5432/TCP       10m
web-svc      LoadBalancer 10.96.88.10    34.93.12.4    80:30007/TCP   5m


When you see CrashLoopBackOff, say:

"First I check logs, then describe the Pod to see events like OOMKilled or probe failures, then verify resources, config, and connectivity."

curl:-

curl is a networking testing tool used in K8s to verify pod, service, API, and internet connectivity.

What is Ingress?

Ingress is a Kubernetes object that manages external access to services, mainly HTTP and HTTPS.

Ingress = rules for traffic

An Ingress Controller is:

A Load Balancer that runs inside Kubernetes and follows Ingress rules.


CrashLoopBackOff is almost always one of:

💥 App crash

🧠 OOMKilled

⚙️ Bad config/env

🔍 Failing health probe

🔌 Dependency unavailable

Start with logs → exit code → events and you’ll find it fast.
